by Jere Nevalainen for Global Game Jam 2016 (theme: RITUAL)

Requirements:
Leap Motion Controller (tested with firmware versio 1.7.0 and software version 2.3.1+31549)

Rules:
- Do the swipe gestures listed on the top part of the screen starting from the left. Do the swipes with one finger only per hand (choice of finger doesn't matter).
- The faster you do the gestures the more score you will get. Every time you finish a set of ritual gestures, the time limit gets shorter.
- Bigger chain means bigger score. Missing a ritual or doing a wrong gesture resets your chain and you take some damage.
- The game ends when you run out of hitpoints. You get some hitpoints back with each succesful ritual gesture.

Hints:
- Seems to work best with index fingers
- Don't move your finger back too fast after doing a swipe! This is a swipe gesture in the opposite direction and usually counts as a mistake.
- Look for "combo" possibilites when two or three consecutive ritual directions go back and forth. Quickly moving your finger left and right or up and down gives nice score in these situations.
